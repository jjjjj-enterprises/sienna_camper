// van floor on their leveling feet -> the flush platform rests DIRECTLY
// on Panel A and B's top rails -> mattress on top. Leveling happens
// down at the leg feet (see the leveling section below), not between
// layers. Every piece bears on the boxes' own rails (plus, for Panel
// B's two halves, a new centre bearer) exactly as the old one-piece
// platform did — nothing is carried by hardware.
//
// The platform spans Panel A + B ONLY and ENDS at the B/C seam:
// Panel C keeps its own fixed 3/4in deck at exactly the same
// surface height (deck_surface_z, 18.5 — C's deck recessed flush,
// A/B rails 3/4in lower under the platform), so the two meet flush and the
// mattress's last ~20in simply rides Panel C's deck. An 80in
// platform would have to sit ON that deck — 3/4in too high — so
// don't build one.
//

// CROSSCUT ONLY — a 1x4 is already 3/4 x 3-1/2, which is the slat spec,
// so there is no ripping anywhere in this component. Five 42in slats

// = 7 boards, plus 52in of 2x2 for the centre bearer. Bought queen slat
// sets are deliberately NOT used: they come stapled to fabric webbing
// or riveted to metal side frames, and neither survives being cut down
// — you destroy the kit to salvage boards you could have bought
// straight.

// ---- SPLIT INTO 3 LIFT-OUT PIECES (owner, Aug 2026) ------------
// The platform is no longer one 58in piece. Panel B's bay is
// top-load-ONLY: the side door aperture measures 35 x 45in with only
// 29in of CLEAR gap at the door's stop (V8), and it sits over Panel A's
// footprint, not Panel B's — so nothing can be reached or pulled
// sideways out of Panel B at all. The ONLY way in is from the top, and
// that used to mean lifting the whole 49x58 platform off and finding
// somewhere in a packed van to put it.
//
// It is now THREE pieces, and only two of them are loose:
//
//   * Panel A's section — 29 x 49in, one piece, SCREWED DOWN and
//     permanent (owner, Aug 2026: it never needed to lift out, because
//     Panel A's two bays are both reached through the side doors —
//     the DELTA 3 drawer pulls out the passenger side, the WAVE 3 bay
//     is reached by hand from the driver side). Fixing it is a real
//     simplification, not just one less loose part:
//       - it becomes a screwed-down DIAPHRAGM across Panel A's rails,
//         putting back some of the torsional stiffness the design lost
//         when Panels A and B gave up their plywood tops (the diagonal
//         corner braces were added to cover that; they now have help
//         rather than carrying it alone),
//       - it is the fore-aft DATUM the two loose halves locate against,
//       - and it needs no anti-rattle pads, because it cannot rattle.
//     Trade: Panel A's bay loses its from-above deep-cleaning route and
//     is side-door-only. Acceptable — the 29in clear side gap exactly
//     spans Panel A's 29in length, and the DELTA drawer (25in fore-aft)
//     comes out through it.
//   * Panel B's TWO HALVES — 29 x 24.5in each, split on the
//     CENTRELINE, each lifting out on its own. Owner's call, Aug 2026.
//
// Why halves rather than one hinged hatch (the design this replaces):
//   1. 24.5in wide PASSES THROUGH the 35in side door. A 49in-wide leaf
//      does not — it could only ever come out the tailgate. Since the
//      whole point is working from a side door with the mattress lifted
//      clear, that difference decides it.
//   2. You remove only the half on the side you are standing at, so the
//      mattress only has to be lifted off half the width.
//   3. No hinge, no lid stay, and no opening-angle limit. A hinged
//      29in leaf could only reach ~67deg before hitting the headliner
//      (there is just 23.5in above the deck), so it needed a prop.
//   4. The centre bearer the halves land on (below) also HALVES the
//      bed's unsupported span over Panel B, from 46in to ~22in. Panel B
//      had no centre divider — Panel A always did — so this is the
//      stiffest the sleeping surface has been.
// Cost of the swap: two loose parts to set down instead of one captive
// lid, and ~+1.7lb over the hinged version.
//
// STILL TRUE: the mattress comes off (or gets folded clear) first. It
// is one 78in piece and Panel B is the MIDDLE third of the bed, so no
// fold uncovers it. Halving the width is what makes that manageable.

// ---- TONGUE -> RAIL CONNECTION (Aug 2026, fully measured) -------
// The anchor board's forward load path. Everything here is measured on
// the vehicle; the reasoning below is compressed on purpose, because this
// joint went through five revisions and the dead ends are worth keeping
// short but not losing.
//
// THE GEOMETRY, as photographed and taped Aug 1 2026:
//   The rail's rear end is closed by a STEEL SADDLE CAP straddling it: a
//   flat TOP face at 1.0in above the floor carrying a single 1/4in round
//   hole (with two closed oblong stiffening dimples either side), two
//   vertical SIDE SKIRTS hanging down, and an OPEN REAR between them.
//   Over the whole thing sits a plastic end cap held by one flush slotted
//   fastener — try a 90deg turn first, that shape is often a quarter-turn
//   catch. Keep both plastic caps for passenger mode.
//
// THE DESIGN: the tongue runs forward off the bridge, steps UP 0.15in,
// rides ON the cap's top face, and a VERTICAL 1/4in PIN drops through the
// tongue into the cap's 1/4in hole. Forward load is carried entirely by
// that pin in SHEAR. Nothing is drilled into the vehicle, and the joint
// comes apart by lifting the tongue.
//
// WHY NOT THE OBVIOUS ALTERNATIVES — all four were tried and dropped:
//   * A FASTENER IN THE TRACK SLOT (T-bolt, channel nut). The slot runs
//     FORE-AFT, the same direction as the load, so it resists forward
//     motion by FRICTION only: ~1,200lb clamp x mu 0.18 = ~215lb per
//     bolt, ~430lb for the pair. That was the original plan's forward
//     path and it was its weakest link.
//   * A NUT BAR SLID IN FROM THE END. Impossible: the steel cap closes
//     the channel and a pin behind it blocks entry from the rear.
//   * BUTTING THE TONGUE ON THE RAIL'S END FACE. There is no such face —
//     the cap's rear is open and its rear edge is a rolled hem.
//   * A BOLT THROUGH THE CAP'S HOLE. Possible but awkward; there is no
//     access behind the top face to start a nut. A pin needs no nut,
//     because the load is shear, not clamp.
//   * (And F7 had already killed butting the striker-row step: carpet
//     over soft trim, not a hard face.)
//
// CAPACITY, and where the limit actually sits:
//   1/4in mild-steel pin, single shear: ~0.049 sq in x ~36ksi
//     ~= 1,760lb per pin, ~3,500lb for the pair.
//   But the GOVERNING limit is HOLE-EDGE BEARING / TEAR-OUT in the cap's
//   stamped top face, not the pin. At an assumed 0.08in thickness the
//   bearing area is 0.25 x 0.08 = 0.02 sq in -> roughly 1,400lb per
//   tongue, ~2,800lb for the pair. Still ~18g on a ~155lb loaded board,
//   and ~6x the friction-only option — but it is the number that matters.
//   MEASURE THE CAP'S THICKNESS to replace that assumption.
//   Nothing in this design is crash-rated; the plan says so throughout.
//
// THE HOLD-DOWN IS ESSENTIAL, NOT OPTIONAL. A vertical pin lifts straight
// out, so something must keep the tongue seated. The cap's open rear makes
// that easy: a clip hooked over the side skirts, or the saddle clamp on
// the rail just forward of the cap. This is the one part of the joint
// still to be chosen by whoever builds it.

// Nowhere inside Panel C's void takes a 2.8in-deep cluster: over the fridge
// stack is 1.09in, over the kitchen under the drawer 0.5in, over the drawer
// under the deck 1.2in. The front wall is the one surface with real room —
// 46 x 17in carrying only a 4.75in fan hole, a 9x2in louver and one 1in
// grommet — so the cluster goes on its Panel-B face, passenger half, clear of

// the W1209's thermistor lead is about 39in and its probe has to sit in the
