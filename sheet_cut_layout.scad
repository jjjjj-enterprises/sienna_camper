// ============================================================
// Plywood cutting layout — what to ask Home Depot to cut (Section 3)
// ============================================================
// Every cut here is a STRAIGHT, full-width or full-length cut, in an
// order a store panel saw can actually follow. The point is to come home
// with rectangles instead of sheets: the only cuts left for the shop are
// the narrow strips (the anchor board's three, among them).
//
// TWO POLICIES BAKED INTO THIS SHEET:
//
//  1. TRIM ALL FOUR FACTORY EDGES ~1/2" FIRST (cuts T1-T4 on every
//     sheet). Factory edges are chipped, out of square and often not
//     straight; every part cut off them inherits that. Trimming first
//     means every subsequent cut references a known-straight edge.
//     Usable size after trimming is 47 x 95 — every part below is
//     checked against THAT, not 48.
//
//  2. THERE IS NO 3/8" PURCHASE AT ALL (owner, Aug 2026). The four parts
//     that used to be 3/8" now come out of the two sheets already being
//     bought: Panel C's front wall and the fridge tray from the 1/2"
//     sheet's big 47x44 leftover, and the battery drawer's 4 walls from
//     the 3/4" sheet — 1 side + 1 front out of its 47x19 strip, the
//     other 2 out of the anchor-strip blank's two big offcuts. Two sheets, two
//     columns. (History: the plan called for a 3/8" HALF sheet, which
//     was 2 sq ft short of the 18.0 sq ft of parts; that was corrected
//     to two 4x4 handy panels, and then deleted outright when the
//     leftovers turned out to cover it.)
//
// Store cuts are numbered S1, S2... in the order they must be made, and
// drawn HEAVY RED. Trim cuts are T. Shop-only cuts are dashed.
//
// Render with: openscad -o renders/sheet-cut-layout.svg sheet_cut_layout.scad
// ============================================================
// LEGIBILITY (Aug 2026): 2 prose line(s) moved out of this
// sheet into the document, and every text size scaled x1.0. Those
// sentences were setting the sheet's width, and a figure's printed
// text height is size x (page_width / sheet_width) — so they were
// holding every other label on the sheet down to 3-6pt on paper.
// Keep prose in the markdown; this sheet carries geometry and short
// labels only.

include <params.scad>
include <van_plan.scad>   // also pulls in sheet2d.scad

// Two sheets, side by side, one row. (History: four sheets across took
// this figure to 227 units wide and every label to ~4.7pt on paper; a
// 2x2 grid halved that; deleting the 3/8" buy removed the bottom row.)
// That halves the sheet's height, and since a figure's printed text
// height is size x (page_width / sheet_width), dropping the unused row
// buys every label on this page real size on paper.
// ONLY selects what this file draws:
//   -1 = both sheets side by side (the figure in Section 3)
//    0 = the 3/4" sheet alone, big, with its cut key beside it
//    1 = the 1/2" sheet alone, same
// The single-sheet variants are the STORE COPY pages in Appendix H — one
// sheet per page at ~2.2x the combined scale, so a label that prints at
// ~5pt on the 2-up figure prints at ~11pt at the saw. Set on the command
// line: openscad -D ONLY=0 -o renders/sheet-cut-1.svg sheet_cut_layout.scad
