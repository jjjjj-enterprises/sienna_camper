"""Render sienna_camper_build_plan.md to a print-ready PDF.

Converts the markdown build plan to styled HTML (with a dedicated
overhead-floorplan section pulled out for visibility), then shells
out to headless Chrome to print it to PDF, and finally stamps a
footer with page numbers onto every page after the cover.

The page-number stamp is a post-process rather than CSS because
Chrome's print-to-PDF does not implement CSS paged-media margin
boxes — `@bottom-center { content: counter(page) }` silently does
nothing there. Chrome's own --print-to-pdf header/footer is the
other option, but the CLI only exposes it as all-or-nothing (it
drags in the URL and the date), so the footer is drawn with
reportlab and merged in with pypdf instead.

    <p><strong>If you build from this plan, you do so entirely at your own risk,
    and you accept full and sole responsibility for the outcome.</strong> The
    author and JJJJJ Enterprises, LLC make no warranty of any kind — express or

    for any personal injury, death, illness, property damage, damage to your
    vehicle, financial loss, or legal consequence</strong> arising directly or
    indirectly from its use, whether or not such harm was foreseeable.</p>

    <p>Work of this kind carries real and serious risks, including but not
    limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Damage to the vehicle</strong> — trim, wiring, floor pan,
          upholstery, seat mechanisms and finish. Modifications may void some or
          all of your manufacturer warranty, and may affect insurance coverage,
          roadworthiness, inspection status, or resale value.</li>
      <li><strong>Airbag, seatbelt and restraint systems.</strong> Seat removal
          and any work near SRS components, pretensioners, or their wiring can
          disable, damage, or unexpectedly deploy safety systems. Airbags can
          cause severe injury or death if triggered during service. Anything
          touching these systems is work for a qualified technician.</li>
      <li><strong>Cargo becoming a projectile.</strong> Furniture, appliances,
          batteries and gear that are not restrained to a genuine crash-rated
          standard can move, break loose, or kill occupants in a collision or
          rollover. Nothing in this plan is crash-rated, and no statement about
          straps, anchors, or load paths here should be read as a safety rating.</li>
      <li><strong>Electrical hazard.</strong> Battery, inverter, and DC wiring
          work risks short circuit, arc flash, burns, lithium battery fire, and
          electrocution. Sizing, fusing, and installation should be checked by a
          qualified person.</li>
      <li><strong>Cooking, heat, and carbon monoxide.</strong> Cooking or running
          any fuel-burning appliance in or near an enclosed vehicle risks fire,
          burns, and carbon monoxide poisoning, which can be fatal while you
          sleep. Ventilate, and fit working CO and smoke alarms.</li>
      <li><strong>Weight, handling and load limits.</strong> Added weight affects
          braking, handling, tire load, and your vehicle's GVWR and axle ratings.
          Verify all figures against your own vehicle's door-jamb placard.</li>
      <li><strong>Tools and materials.</strong> Power tools, sharp edges, dust,
          adhesives, and finishes cause injury. Follow every manufacturer's
          instructions and use appropriate protective equipment.</li>
      <li><strong>Law and regulation.</strong> Vehicle modification, occupancy,
          and where you may sleep in a vehicle are governed by local law. Confirm
          what applies to you; compliance is your responsibility alone.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Verify every dimension on your own vehicle before cutting
    anything.</strong> The measurements here were taken on one specific van and
    may not match yours, and errors — in measurement, in transcription, or in the
    drawings — are possible throughout.</p>

### Whole-Vehicle Overview

![Whole vehicle overview](renders/vehicle-overview.png)

*Side profile of the van, front at left and tailgate at right, with the cargo envelope, liftgate opening and platform drawn to scale inside an illustrative body outline. **Numbered callouts:** **1** sitting headroom, mattress top to ceiling. **2** Panels A / B / C with the mattress above. **3** the rear pantry (prefab drawer cluster), **4** sitting on Panel C's deck. **5** the fridge and kitchen unit, hidden under Panel C's deck. Body outline illustrative; the interior and platform dimensions are to scale. The names were moved off the sheet — its geometry is already 258 units long, so its own labels were holding every one of them to ~5pt on the page.*

### Overhead Floorplan

![No-drill anchor platform — overhead detail](renders/anchor-platform-overhead.png)

*The no-drill rail platform (Section 8) in plan view, before the whole-van floorplan below: the mat + ply anchor board under Panel C, its 2 steel tongues bolted to the rear ends of the 2nd-row long-slide floor rails, and its 3 ratchet straps dropping into the crash-rated 3rd-row striker loops. Tailgate at the bottom, forward at the top.*

**What this platform is.** A skeleton of 3/4" plywood on a non-slip rubber mat,
laid on the van floor. It is **ONE comb-shaped piece** — a full-width BRIDGE
with 3 narrow STRIPS running back from it (the hatched shape on the sheet), cut
from a single 46"×33" blank. There are **no joints in it**: nothing is glued or
screwed to another piece of ply. It is **not** a full plywood floor — nothing
sits under the fridge tray or the kitchen unit, where the van floor stays bare.

**The appliances anchor to the BOARD.** The fridge slide's steel riser angles
bolt to the two rail-line strips (1/4-20 T-nuts), and the kitchen's 4 ratchet
straps criss-cross into L-track D-rings on its two flanking strips.

**The board anchors to the VAN at two factory hardpoints — zero new holes.**

- **RAILS:** 2 steel tongues (2"×3/16" flat bar) bolt under the bridge and bolt/clamp to the 2nd-row floor rails' rear ends → takes the FORWARD crash load.
- **STRIKERS:** 3 ratchet straps run from bridge D-rings into the 3rd-row striker loops → takes REARWARD + LIFT loads, and they pin the board down.

Rail-end and striker positions are **ASSUMED** until the Appendix A F1–F8
survey. (This explanation used to be printed as a 20-line block below the
drawing. It is what made that sheet 101 units tall, and since sheet height sets
printed text size, it was holding its own lines — and every label on the drawing
— to about 5pt on paper.)
