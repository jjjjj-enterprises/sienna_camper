// Rear-floor survey (F1-F8) — one WHOLE-VEHICLE plan per section
// ============================================================
// Appendix A's rear-floor survey used to be a table with thumbnail key
// maps of the cargo zone alone. It is now one section per measurement,
// and each gets a full page-width drawing of the WHOLE Sienna in plan,
// so the thing you are being asked to measure is located against the
// actual vehicle rather than an abstract rectangle.
//
// Every drawing is the same base plan — body outline, front seats, the
// empty 2nd-row bay with its long-slide floor rails, the folded 3rd row
// and its stowage well, the sliding-door openings, Panel C's footprint
// — with only that section's measurement drawn in RED, labelled, and
// dimensioned. F3 and F7 also carry a small section inset, because a
// depth and a step height cannot be shown in plan; F8 carries three
// detail bubbles for the rail-end cases you have to tell apart.
//
// Layout: the vehicle sits in the middle, fore-aft dimension lines go
// in the band ABOVE it, and the badge + wording for that section goes
// in the band BELOW it (with any insets to the right of the wording).
// Keeping text in its own band is what stops it colliding with the
// drawing or running off the sheet.
//
// Orientation: FRONT at the LEFT, TAILGATE at the RIGHT, matching the
// side-profile render. Looking down from above with the nose at the
// left puts the DRIVER side along the BOTTOM edge.
//
// Datum: the survey's own Y = 0 is the CLOSED HATCH, +Y forward, and
// its X = 0 is the DRIVER-side edge of the usable floor — the same
// datum every other Appendix A/8 drawing uses. sx()/sy() convert those
// survey coordinates into sheet coordinates, so the numbers in this
// file stay readable as survey numbers.
//
// The body outline is ILLUSTRATIVE (published Sienna exterior figures,
// ~200" x 78"); the interior features are the ASSUMED positions this
// very survey exists to confirm, so they are drawn dashed.
//
